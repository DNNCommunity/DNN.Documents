# DotNetNuke Documents Module

A simple document management module for DotNetNuke & Evoq.  This module has been maintained from very early versions of DotNetNuke and migrated from CodePlex.

## Minimum DNN Versions

### DNN Documents 8.0.0 and Later

The current release requires DNN Platform 9.2.1 or later and .NET 4.7 and later.  

This release has been tested to work with DNN Platform 10.x

### DNN Documents 7.x Version

This version required .NET 4.0 and supported DNN Platform 7.0.0 through 9.13.10.  

Version 7.x WILL NOT work successfully with DNN Platform 10.x and should be updated to at minimum 8.0.0 prior to upgrading to DNN Platform 10.x

### DNN Documents Prior to 7.x

Versions older than 7.0.0 are considered extremely legacy and an upgrade to version 7.0.0 should be completed PRIOR to upgrading to DNN Platform 9.2.0.
